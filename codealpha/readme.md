# Fibonacci Sequence Generator

This is my commit about the Fibonacci Sequence!

As I am a intern a codealpha , this topic (Fibonacci Sequence) as my first challenge to create a program that can generate and store all numbers from the Fibonacci sequence.
# WARNING!
It is not recommended to go above 1,000. After that the code won't be instantaneous and will take more time to generate the next numbers in the sequence!

# Remember: The only limitation to this program is your computer! Be careful! Use with caution!
